# SONIC_Sound-Optimisation-for-Noise-in-Crowds
I guided a team of six junior engineers for over a year in developing a novel, embedded real-time noise suppression system. Our objective was to harness the full DSP capabilities of the ARM Cortex-M7-based STM32H753ZI to perform adaptive filtering in crowded environments, creating a low-power alternative to computationally expensive AI methods. I led the project lifecycle, from initial algorithm research where we benchmarked LMS, RLS, and meta-heuristic approaches to architecting the final hardware implementation. My direct technical contribution involved architecting the real-time audio pipeline. I implemented a circular double-buffering system using DMA to stream data from dual I2S microphones and leveraged the chip's FPU with the CMSIS-DSP library to execute the LMS filter with minimal latency. A critical challenge emerged when the onboard 12-bit DAC severely truncated our 24-bit audio signal, causing significant quantization noise. I diagnosed this bottleneck and led the successful integration of an external Class-D audio amplifier, restoring full audio fidelity. The final system achieved a 7 dB SNR improvement and a MOS score of 4.47, culminating in a publication (First Author). This project solidified my expertise in hardware-software co-design and real-time signal processing.
